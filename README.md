#### Docker

```sh
docker run --name docuseal -p 3000:3000 -v.:/data docuseal/docuseal
```

By default DocuSeal docker container uses an SQLite database to store data and configurations. Alternatively, it is possible use PostgreSQL or MySQL databases by specifying the `DATABASE_URL` env variable.

#### Docker Compose

Download docker-compose.yml into your private server:
```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docusealco/docuseal/master/docker-compose.yml > docker-compose.yml
```

Run the app under a custom domain over https using docker compose (make sure your DNS points to the server to automatically issue ssl certs with Caddy):
```sh
sudo HOST=your-domain-name.com docker compose up
```

#### Updating Docker Deployment

When updating to a new version, pull the latest image and run database migrations:

```sh
# Pull the latest image
docker pull docuseal/docuseal

# Restart the container (or use docker compose pull && docker compose up -d)
docker compose up -d

# Run database migrations (app is located in /app directory)
docker exec -it -w /app <container_name> bundle exec rails db:migrate
```

> **Why run migrations?** Database migrations apply schema changes required by new features (new tables, columns, indexes). Without running migrations after an update, new features may not work correctly or the application may encounter errors when accessing updated database structures.

## Custom Features

### Phone OTP Verification via Webhook

Send OTP codes to your own SMS gateway for phone verification before signing. Configure in **Settings > Phone OTP**:

- **Webhook URL**: Your SMS gateway endpoint
- **Bearer Token**: Optional authentication token

When phone 2FA is enabled for a template, the system sends a POST request with:
```json
{
  "phone_number": "+1234567890",
  "otp": "123456",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "submitter_id": 123,
  "submitter_email": "user@example.com",
  "submitter_name": "John Doe",
  "submission_id": 456,
  "template_name": "Contract Template"
}
```

### Consent Document Requirement

Require signers to acknowledge terms and conditions before signing. Configure at two levels:

1. **Account Level** (Settings > Consent Document): Set default consent URL and text
2. **Template Level** (Template > Preferences > Form Preferences): Enable/disable per template with optional overrides

When enabled, signers must view the document and check the consent checkbox before accessing the signing form.

### Role-Based Access Control

Three user roles with different permissions:
- **Admin**: Full access to all resources
- **Editor**: Can manage their own templates and submissions
- **Viewer**: Read-only access to shared resources

Templates and folders can be shared between users for collaboration.
